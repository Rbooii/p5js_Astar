# A* Algorithm
This is a simple implementation of A* (optimized djikstra) algorithm written fully in javascript with the help of p5.js library.
p5js is a client side js library for manipulating html DOM directly, so us developers can just focus on the code and our creativity!

### what are that line doing ?
so the code started from the top left corner and the code must solve a pathfinding challenge trough a tough random placed obstacles untill it met the bottom right corner.

### how to use ?
simply you guys can just git pull this repo and then start a local nodejs http server targeting the index.html (or use vscode liveserver extension for easier approach).
